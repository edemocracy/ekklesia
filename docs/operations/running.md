# Running In Production

A production environment can be built by Nix. The generated output
doesnâ€™t have additional requirements. The application can be run by a
start script directly or using the Docker image built by Nix. Static
assets are built separately and can be served by the included minimal
Nginx. As for the application itself, we can build a standalone start
script or a Docker image.

## NixOS Module

There's a NixOS module in {file}`nix/modules/default.nix` to run the backend.

See [ekklesia.nix in ekklesia-deploy](https://github.com/edemocracy/ekklesia-deploy/blob/main/ekklesia.nix) for an
example on how to use the module. In ekklesia-deploy, you can also see how
you can pin the version of ekklesia-portal using niv and how to service
static files with Nginx.

## With Docker

By default, Docker images are tagged with a version string derived from
the last Git tag. You can set a different tag by adding
`--argstr tag mytag` to the `docker*.nix` calls.

- Build app image as `docker-image-ekklesia-portal.tar` and import it:

  ```
  ./docker.nix --argstr tag mytag docker load -i docker-image-ekklesia-portal.tar
  ```

- Build and import static file image:

  ```
  ./docker_static.nix --argstr tag mytag docker load -i docker-image-ekklesia-portal-static.tar
  ```

- Run app container:

  ```
  docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -it -v $(pwd)/config-docker.yml:/config.yml ekklesia-portal:mytag
  ```

- Run static file container:

  ```
  docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8081:8080 -it ekklesia-portal-static:mytag
  ```

The app is now served at port 8080 and static files at port 8081 which
are only reachable from localhost (127.0.0.1).

## Directly From Source

- Build and run app with the config file `config.yml`:

  ```
  nix-build nix/serve_app.nix -o serve_app && serve_app/bin/run
  ```

To change the config location, set the environment variable {code}`EKKLESIA_PORTAL_CONFIG`.

- Build static assets and run Nginx:

  ```
  nix-build nix/serve_static.nix -o serve_static && serve_static/bin/run
  ```

- Build static assets for use with another web server:

  ```
  nix-build nix/static_files.nix -o static_files
  ```
