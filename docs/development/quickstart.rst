Development Quick Start
***********************

This chapter describes briefly how to set up a development environment to run a local instance of the application.

Setting up the environment for testing and running tests is described in :ref:`testing`.


.. note::

    The following instructions assume that *Nix* and *lorri* are already installed,
    and an empty + writable PostgreSQL database can be accessed somehow.
    If you don't have *Nix* and *lorri* or canâ€™t use an existing PostgreSQL server,
    have a look at :ref:`dev-env`.

.. note::

    It's strongly recommended to also follow the instructions at :ref:`cachix-binary-cache`
    or the first step will take a long time to complete.


1. Clone the repository and enter nix shell in the project root folder to open a shell which is
   your dev environment::

    git clone https://github.com/edemocracy/ekklesia-portal
    cd ekklesia-portal
    lorri shell

2. Compile translations and CSS (look at dodo.py to see what this does)::

    doit

3. Create a config file named ``config.yml`` using the config template
   from ``src/ekklesia_portal/config.example.yml`` or skip this to use
   the default settings from ``src/ekklesia_portal/default_settings.py``.
   Make sure that the database connection string points to an
   empty + writable database.

4. Initialize the dev database with a custom config file::

    python tests/create_test_db.py -c config.yml


5. The development server can be run with a custom config file by
   executing::

    python src/ekklesia_portal/runserver.py --debug -c config.yml 2>&1 | eliot-tree -l0
