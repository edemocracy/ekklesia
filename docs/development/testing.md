# Testing

Tests are written and executed using [pytest](https://pytest.org).

## Setup

If you don't have *Nix with Flakes support* or canâ€™t use an existing PostgreSQL
server, have a look at {ref}`dev-env`.

Steps 1 and 2 can be skipped when you already followed {ref}`quickstart`.
Steps 3 and 4 set up a separate database for running the tests.

1. Clone the repository and enter Nix dev shell in the project root folder to 
   open a
   shell which is your test environment:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/edemocracy/ekklesia-portal
   cd ekklesia-portal
   nix develop
   ```

2. Compile translations and CSS (look at `dodo.py` to see what this does):

   ```
   doit
   ```

3. Make sure that the database connection URL points to an empty + writable
   database.
   By default, the tests use the Postgres socket in {file}`/tmp` and the
   database name is
   `test_ekklesia_portal`. You can set the environment variable
   `EKKLESIA_PORTAL_TEST_DB_URL` to customize the database connection.

4. Set up the database for testing (look at `flake.nix` to see what this does):

   ```
   create_test_db
   ```

## Running Tests

The tests can be run inside a Nix dev shell with the {command}`pytest`
command from the repository root directory.

You can supply a path to run only a part of the test suite, here only for the
proposition concept:

```
pytest tests/concepts/proposition
```

This also works for single modules:

```
pytest tests/concepts/proposition/test_propositions.py
```

Or you can select tests by a part of the name:

```
pytest -k test_arg
```

See the [Usage and Invocations](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/usage.html)
in the pytest documentation for more info.
